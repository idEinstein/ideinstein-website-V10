## Detailed Compliance Analysis

### A01: Broken Access Control

**Description:** Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced.

**Status:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Implemented Controls:**
- **Admin Authentication** (implemented): Secure admin authentication system with password hashing and session management

### A02: Cryptographic Failures

**Description:** Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure.

**Status:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Implemented Controls:**
- **Admin Authentication** (implemented): Secure admin authentication system with password hashing and session management

### A03: Injection

**Description:** An application is vulnerable to attack when user-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized.

**Status:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Implemented Controls:**
- **Security Middleware** (implemented): Enterprise-grade security middleware with HMAC, CSP, rate limiting, and security headers
- **Input Validation** (implemented): Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas for forms and API endpoints

### A04: Insecure Design

**Description:** Risks related to design flaws and missing or ineffective control design.

**Status:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Implemented Controls:**
- **Input Validation** (implemented): Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas for forms and API endpoints

### A05: Security Misconfiguration

**Description:** Missing appropriate security hardening or improperly configured permissions.

**Status:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Implemented Controls:**
- **Security Middleware** (implemented): Enterprise-grade security middleware with HMAC, CSP, rate limiting, and security headers
- **Rate Limiting** (implemented): Comprehensive rate limiting system with configurable limits per endpoint type
- **Security Headers** (implemented): Security headers implementation (4/5 headers)

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

**Description:** Components with known vulnerabilities or that are out of date or unsupported.

**Status:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Implemented Controls:**
- **Dependency Scanning** (implemented): Automated dependency vulnerability scanning with multiple fallback methods

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

**Description:** Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management.

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT ADDRESSED

**Recommendations:**
- Review and implement controls for Identification and Authentication Failures

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Description:** Code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT ADDRESSED

**Recommendations:**
- Review and implement controls for Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Conduct risk assessment for this category
- Consider industry best practices and frameworks

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Description:** Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration.

**Status:** ‚úÖ ADDRESSED

**Implemented Controls:**
- **Security Logging** (implemented): Comprehensive security event logging and monitoring

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description:** SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT ADDRESSED

**Recommendations:**
- Review and implement controls for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Conduct risk assessment for this category
- Consider industry best practices and frameworks
