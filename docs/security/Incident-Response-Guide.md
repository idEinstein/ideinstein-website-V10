Generated: 2025-09-19T15:50:08.987Z

## Overview

This guide provides procedures for responding to security incidents, including detection, containment, eradication, and recovery.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Active breach, data exposure, system compromise
- **HIGH**: Attempted breach, vulnerability exploitation, service disruption
- **MEDIUM**: Suspicious activity, policy violations, minor security issues
- **LOW**: Security warnings, informational alerts, routine monitoring

## Detection and Monitoring

### Security Monitoring Points

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Multiple failed login attempts
   - Unusual login patterns
   - Brute force attacks

2. **Rate Limiting Violations**
   - Excessive API requests
   - Automated bot activity
   - DDoS attempts

3. **Input Validation Failures**
   - SQL injection attempts
   - XSS payload detection
   - Malformed requests

4. **CSP Violations**
   - Unauthorized script execution
   - Content injection attempts
   - Policy violations

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check security logs
npm run security:audit

# Monitor rate limiting
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/security/rate-limit?timeframe=1h"

# Check dependency vulnerabilities
npm run dependency:scan
```

## Response Procedures

### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)

1. **Assess the Situation**
   - Determine incident severity
   - Identify affected systems
   - Document initial findings

2. **Contain the Incident**
   - Block malicious IPs if identified
   - Reset rate limits if under attack
   - Disable affected features if necessary

3. **Notify Stakeholders**
   - Alert system administrators
   - Inform relevant team members
   - Document communication

### Short-term Response (15 minutes - 4 hours)

1. **Investigation**
   - Analyze security logs
   - Review system access
   - Identify attack vectors

2. **Containment**
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update security configurations
   - Monitor for continued activity

3. **Evidence Collection**
   - Preserve log files
   - Document attack patterns
   - Capture system state

### Recovery and Post-Incident (4+ hours)

1. **Eradication**
   - Remove malicious content
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security controls

2. **Recovery**
   - Restore normal operations
   - Verify system integrity
   - Monitor for recurrence

3. **Lessons Learned**
   - Conduct post-incident review
   - Update security procedures
   - Implement preventive measures
