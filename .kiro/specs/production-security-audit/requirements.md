# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive production security audit system to identify and remediate debug scripts, loose ends, and potential security vulnerabilities before deployment. The system will scan the entire codebase, identify security risks, and provide automated cleanup capabilities to ensure production readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to scan the entire codebase for debug scripts and development artifacts, so that I can ensure no debugging code reaches production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security audit is executed THEN the system SHALL scan all files in the project directory
2. WHEN debug scripts are found THEN the system SHALL identify their location and security risk level
3. WHEN development-only code is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for removal or protection
4. WHEN the scan completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report of all findings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to identify exposed API endpoints and debug routes, so that I can secure or remove them before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning API routes THEN the system SHALL identify all debug and diagnostic endpoints
2. WHEN debug endpoints are found THEN the system SHALL assess their security implications
3. WHEN production-unsafe routes exist THEN the system SHALL recommend removal or protection strategies
4. WHEN API endpoints lack proper authentication THEN the system SHALL flag them as security risks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to detect hardcoded secrets and sensitive information, so that I can prevent credential exposure in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning code files THEN the system SHALL detect hardcoded API keys, passwords, and tokens
2. WHEN sensitive data patterns are found THEN the system SHALL flag them with severity levels
3. WHEN environment variables are improperly used THEN the system SHALL recommend secure alternatives
4. WHEN the scan finds credentials THEN the system SHALL provide remediation guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to validate environment configurations, so that I can ensure proper security settings are applied across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating environments THEN the system SHALL check all environment variable configurations
2. WHEN insecure configurations are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them with recommended fixes
3. WHEN production settings differ from security requirements THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
4. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide a security compliance report

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated cleanup capabilities, so that I can quickly remediate identified security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security issues are identified THEN the system SHALL provide automated fix options
2. WHEN cleanup is requested THEN the system SHALL safely remove or secure flagged items
3. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL create backups before making changes
4. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL verify that fixes don't break functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to generate security documentation, so that I can maintain compliance and audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed security reports
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL include remediation steps and timelines
3. WHEN compliance checks run THEN the system SHALL verify adherence to security standards
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include executive summaries and technical details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate security scanning into the deployment pipeline, so that I can prevent insecure code from reaching production automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL automatically run security scans
2. WHEN critical security issues are found THEN the system SHALL block deployment
3. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time security feedback
4. WHEN deployment proceeds THEN the system SHALL ensure all security checks have passed
