# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create production audit script

  - Create `scripts/production-audit.ts` with file scanning and debug code detection
  - Implement pattern matching for console.log, TODO comments, debug endpoints, and hardcoded secrets
  - Add colored console output for clear issue reporting
  - Include file and line number information for each issue found
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Create production cleanup script

  - Create `scripts/production-cleanup.ts` with automated debug code removal
  - Implement safe removal of console.log statements with backup creation
  - Add functionality to comment out TODO comments instead of removing them
  - Include validation to ensure files remain syntactically correct after cleanup
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 3. Create production readiness validator

  - Create `scripts/validate-production-ready.ts` for quick production checks
  - Implement environment variable validation for production settings
  - Add checks for debug endpoints and unsafe configurations
  - Include overall production readiness score calculation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement file backup and restore system

  - Add backup creation functionality with timestamp-based naming
  - Create `.production-audit-backups/` directory structure
  - Implement restore functionality for rollback capability
  - Add cleanup of old backup files after successful deployment
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 6.1_

- [ ] 5. Add package.json scripts and documentation

  - Add npm scripts for `audit:production`, `cleanup:production`, `validate:production`
  - Create combined `prepare:production` script that runs all checks and cleanup
  - Add README documentation for script usage and CI/CD integration
  - Include examples of script output and common issues found
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 6.2_

- [ ] 6. Create debug pattern detection engine

  - Implement comprehensive regex patterns for common debug code
  - Add detection for console statements, TODO comments, debug endpoints
  - Include hardcoded secret detection patterns
  - Add file type filtering to skip binary files and node_modules
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Implement production configuration validation

  - Add validation for middleware.ts security settings
  - Check next.config.js for production-safe configurations
  - Validate environment variable usage and exposure
  - Include checks for debug mode flags and development settings
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 2.3_

- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and logging

  - Implement proper error handling for file operations
  - Add detailed logging for all scan and cleanup operations
  - Include proper exit codes for CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Add validation to ensure cleanup doesn't break functionality
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 6.3_

- [ ] 9. Create integration tests for audit scripts

  - Write test files with known debug code patterns
  - Test audit script detection accuracy and completeness
  - Verify cleanup script safety and backup creation
  - Test production readiness validation with various configurations
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 5.6_

- [ ] 10. Add CI/CD integration examples
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow example for pre-deployment audit
  - Add Vercel build hook integration for automated production checks
  - Include documentation for blocking deployment on critical issues
  - Add examples for different deployment scenarios
  - _Requirements: 7.2, 7.3_
