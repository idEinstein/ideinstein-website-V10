# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes the admin login authentication issue that occurred after switching from plain password to hashed password authentication. The existing admin dashboard works perfectly, but the login process is failing due to cached invalid tokens and hash validation problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As the admin user, I want to be able to log into my existing admin dashboard, so that I can access the system I've already built.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter my admin password THEN the system SHALL authenticate me and show the dashboard
2. WHEN I have old cached tokens THEN the system SHALL automatically clear them
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN I SHALL be redirected to the existing admin dashboard
4. WHEN I'm already logged in THEN the system SHALL remember my session for 24 hours

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the admin user, I want to understand why login is failing, so that I can fix the issue quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages
2. WHEN there are cache issues THEN the system SHALL automatically clear browser storage
3. WHEN hash validation fails THEN the system SHALL indicate if it's a password or system problem
4. WHEN I need to debug THEN the system SHALL provide console logs with diagnostic information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As the admin user, I want the bcrypt hash authentication to work correctly, so that my login is secure and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit my password THEN the system SHALL validate it against the ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH using bcrypt
2. WHEN the hash comparison succeeds THEN the system SHALL create a valid authentication token
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL show configuration errors
4. WHEN bcrypt fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As the admin user, I want a simple way to fix authentication issues, so that I don't get locked out of my own system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have authentication problems THEN the system SHALL provide a "Clear All Cache" button
2. WHEN I clear cache THEN the system SHALL remove all stored authentication data and reload
3. WHEN I need to verify my setup THEN the system SHALL provide a diagnostic endpoint
4. WHEN configuration is wrong THEN the system SHALL show exact steps to fix it
