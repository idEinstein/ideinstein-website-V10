# Homepage Enhancement Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current IdEinstein homepage lacks the premium polish, consistency, and interactive engagement found on the startup, enterprise, and about pages. **Critical issues identified:**

- **Button inconsistency**: Sizes and styles don't match the unified button system used on other pages
- **Poor mobile animations**: Card animations are "brick drop bumping" instead of smooth transitions
- **Design system inconsistency**: Homepage doesn't use UnifiedCard and UnifiedSection components
- **Missing premium polish**: Lacks the sophisticated hover states and micro-interactions of other pages

This enhancement will prioritize immediate polish fixes while building toward a more interactive, visually engaging homepage that matches the quality of other site pages.

**Technical Analysis:**
- **Current**: Custom card styling with basic hover:scale-105 transforms
- **Target**: UnifiedCard components with smooth animations and proper mobile touch states
- **Current**: Inconsistent button variants and sizes
- **Target**: Standardized button system with proper variant usage
- **Current**: Abrupt mobile animations causing jarring user experience
- **Target**: Smooth, eased transitions with proper active states

**Reference Site Inspiration:**
- **PADT**: 3D animated engineering components, bold messaging, floating technical elements
- **Nevatio**: Clean industrial aesthetics, "On Demand Engineering" efficiency focus
- **Valta**: "Ready to create" approach, comprehensive service showcases
