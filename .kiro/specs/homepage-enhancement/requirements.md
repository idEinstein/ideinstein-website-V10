# Homepage Enhancement Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current IdEinstein homepage lacks the premium polish, consistency, and interactive engagement found on the startup, enterprise, and about pages. Based on analysis of the existing codebase and research of modern engineering websites (including PADT, Nevatio, and Valta Engineering), this enhancement will transform the homepage into a compelling, interactive experience that matches the quality of other site pages while reducing text-heavy content in favor of visual storytelling and process flow diagrams.

**Key Inspiration from Reference Sites:**
- **PADT**: 3D animated engineering components with realistic physics, bold "We Make Innovation Work" messaging, floating technical elements, wireframe overlays, interactive technical diagrams
- **Nevatio**: Clean industrial photography backgrounds, "On Demand Engineering" concept emphasizing flexibility, efficiency-focused messaging, streamlined user flows, professional manufacturing imagery
- **Valta**: "Ready to create" call-to-action approach, comprehensive services showcase with visual previews, product development focus, interactive service demonstrations

4. WHEN a user scans the page THEN key benefits and features SHALL be immediately visible through visual hierarchy
5. WHEN a user wants to learn more THEN clear pathways to detailed information SHALL be provided

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Animation and Micro-Interactions

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want engaging animations and micro-interactions inspired by PADT's 3D visualizations that demonstrate engineering precision and attention to detail, so that I feel confident in IdEinstein's technical capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls through sections THEN elements SHALL animate in with purposeful, engineering-inspired motion including floating 3D components and physics-based interactions
2. WHEN a user hovers over interactive elements THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback with technical wireframe overlays and component highlighting
3. WHEN a user interacts with process diagrams THEN animations SHALL demonstrate flow and connectivity with realistic engineering component movements
4. WHEN a user views loading states THEN they SHALL use engineering-themed animations (rotating gears, blueprint drawing, CAD assembly sequences)
5. WHEN a user experiences animations THEN they SHALL enhance rather than distract from the content while showcasing technical sophistication

### Requirement 5: Mobile-First Interactive Experience

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the same engaging interactive experience as desktop users, with touch-optimized controls and responsive animations, so that I can fully evaluate IdEinstein's services on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on mobile THEN all interactive elements SHALL be touch-optimized
2. WHEN a user interacts with process flows on mobile THEN they SHALL use swipe gestures and touch-friendly controls
3. WHEN a user views animations on mobile THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance and battery life
4. WHEN a user navigates on mobile THEN button sizes and spacing SHALL be consistent with other mobile pages
5. WHEN a user experiences the mobile site THEN it SHALL feel like a native app experience

### Requirement 6: Engineering Process Showcase
