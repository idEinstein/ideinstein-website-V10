# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements enterprise-grade security enhancements to address critical gaps identified in our security audit. The system will upgrade our authentication to JWT-based security, implement data encryption at rest, enhance rate limiting with Redis, secure Zoho integrations, and configure advanced Vercel security features to achieve 95%+ compliance with OWASP 2024, SOC2, and enterprise security standards.

## Requirements

3. WHEN JWT tokens are created THEN the system SHALL include proper issuer, audience, and security claims
4. WHEN JWT tokens are validated THEN the system SHALL verify signature, expiration, and claims securely
5. WHEN admin routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL use JWT authentication instead of basic tokens
6. WHEN JWT secrets are managed THEN the system SHALL use environment variables with proper rotation capabilities

### Requirement 2: Data Encryption at Rest

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to implement AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data at rest, so that confidential information is protected even if storage is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it using AES-256-GCM algorithm
2. WHEN encrypted data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL decrypt it securely with proper authentication
3. WHEN encryption keys are managed THEN the system SHALL use secure key derivation and rotation
4. WHEN admin credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them with additional security layers
5. WHEN configuration data contains secrets THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive values
6. WHEN encryption operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors securely without exposing data

### Requirement 3: Advanced Rate Limiting with Redis

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to implement Redis-based sliding window rate limiting, so that we can protect against sophisticated attacks and distributed abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL use Redis with sliding window algorithms
2. WHEN different endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL apply endpoint-specific rate limits
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback and retry information
4. WHEN distributed requests occur THEN the system SHALL coordinate rate limiting across multiple instances
5. WHEN rate limit data is stored THEN the system SHALL use efficient Redis data structures
6. WHEN rate limiting is monitored THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics and alerting

### Requirement 4: Zoho Integration Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to comprehensively secure our Zoho CRM integration, so that API communications are protected against data breaches and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Zoho API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and token refresh
2. WHEN Zoho tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle refresh securely with proper error handling
3. WHEN Zoho API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events and implement proper fallbacks
4. WHEN Zoho rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent backoff and queuing
5. WHEN Zoho data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs and outputs
6. WHEN Zoho integration fails THEN the system SHALL maintain security posture and prevent data exposure

### Requirement 5: Vercel Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure advanced Vercel security features, so that our infrastructure is protected with enterprise-grade security controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Vercel WAF is configured THEN the system SHALL enable OWASP Top 10 protection rules
2. WHEN preview deployments are created THEN the system SHALL require authentication for access
3. WHEN staging environments are deployed THEN the system SHALL implement password protection
4. WHEN DDoS attacks occur THEN the system SHALL activate Challenge Mode protection
5. WHEN production traffic is analyzed THEN the system SHALL monitor and log security events
6. WHEN security rules are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide detailed incident reporting

### Requirement 6: Security Testing Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated security testing integrated into our CI/CD pipeline, so that security vulnerabilities are detected before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run automated security scans
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL validate security implications
3. WHEN security tests fail THEN the system SHALL block deployment and provide detailed reports
4. WHEN security scans complete THEN the system SHALL generate compliance documentation
5. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL provide remediation guidance
6. WHEN security metrics change THEN the system SHALL update monitoring dashboards

### Requirement 7: Compliance Documentation and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive security documentation and monitoring, so that we can achieve SOC2 and enterprise certifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security audits run THEN the system SHALL generate certification-ready documentation
2. WHEN compliance frameworks are evaluated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed gap analysis
3. WHEN security metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track compliance scores over time
4. WHEN security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed audit trails
5. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include executive summaries
6. WHEN certification requirements change THEN the system SHALL update compliance tracking

### Requirement 8: Security Incident Response

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want automated incident response capabilities, so that security threats are detected and mitigated quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security threats are detected THEN the system SHALL trigger automated response procedures
2. WHEN critical vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately
3. WHEN security metrics degrade THEN the system SHALL escalate alerts based on severity
4. WHEN incidents are resolved THEN the system SHALL document lessons learned and improvements
5. WHEN response procedures execute THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed incident logs
6. WHEN security posture changes THEN the system SHALL update risk assessments automatically

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want security enhancements to maintain system performance, so that security improvements don't impact user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times
2. WHEN encryption is applied THEN the system SHALL optimize for minimal performance impact
3. WHEN rate limiting is enforced THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms and caching
4. WHEN security monitoring runs THEN the system SHALL minimize resource consumption
5. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN the system SHALL scale security operations appropriately
6. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 10: Integration and Backward Compatibility
