# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical security incident where production environment files containing sensitive keys and secrets were accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository. While the files have been immediately removed from GitHub, we need to implement a comprehensive incident response to secure the system and prevent future occurrences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to immediately assess and rotate all potentially compromised credentials, so that the system remains secure after the accidental exposure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security incident involving credential exposure occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive audit of all exposed credentials
2. WHEN credentials are identified as compromised THEN the system SHALL provide automated rotation procedures for each credential type
3. WHEN credential rotation is performed THEN the system SHALL validate that new credentials are properly configured and functional
4. WHEN credential rotation is complete THEN the system SHALL update all dependent services and configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the sole administrator, I want clear procedures for handling security incidents, so that I can respond quickly and effectively to minimize security risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security incident occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a step-by-step incident response checklist
2. WHEN following incident response procedures THEN the system SHALL validate each step is completed successfully
3. WHEN incident response is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive incident report for my records
4. WHEN incident response procedures are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain current documentation for future reference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated prevention measures in place, so that similar credential exposure incidents cannot occur in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically scan for potential credential exposure
2. WHEN environment files are modified THEN the system SHALL validate they are properly excluded from version control
3. WHEN new environment variables are added THEN the system SHALL ensure they follow security best practices
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL verify no sensitive data is included in the deployment package

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As the business owner, I want complete documentation of the security incident and response, so that I have proper records and can demonstrate security diligence if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security incident occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically log all incident details with timestamps
2. WHEN incident response actions are taken THEN the system SHALL document each action and its outcome
3. WHEN the incident is resolved THEN the system SHALL generate a complete incident report including timeline, impact assessment, and remediation steps
4. WHEN incident documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL store it securely for future reference

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to verify that all services continue to function properly after credential rotation, so that business operations are not disrupted by the security response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are rotated THEN the system SHALL test all dependent service connections
2. WHEN service testing is complete THEN the system SHALL verify all integrations are functioning properly
3. WHEN integration testing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and rollback procedures
4. WHEN all services are verified THEN the system SHALL confirm the incident response is complete and systems are secure
