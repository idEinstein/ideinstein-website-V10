# Security Dashboard Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The security dashboard is currently showing false negative results and not properly detecting existing security implementations. This feature will fix the security audit detection logic and address any actual security gaps to achieve full OWASP 2024 compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the security dashboard to accurately detect existing security implementations, so that I can trust the security status reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security audit runs THEN it SHALL correctly detect the existing middleware.ts file
2. WHEN checking admin authentication THEN it SHALL recognize the working admin-auth.ts system
3. WHEN validating security headers THEN it SHALL detect the implemented headers in middleware
4. WHEN checking rate limiting THEN it SHALL recognize the active rate limiting system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to fix any actual security vulnerabilities identified by the audit, so that my system achieves full OWASP 2024 compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input validation is missing THEN the system SHALL implement Zod validation schemas for all API routes
2. WHEN dependency vulnerabilities exist THEN the system SHALL provide tools to identify and fix them
3. WHEN security documentation is missing THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive security docs
4. WHEN cryptographic implementations need validation THEN the system SHALL verify secure implementations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the security dashboard to provide actionable recommendations, so that I can easily implement security improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific fix instructions
2. WHEN compliance gaps exist THEN the system SHALL offer automated fix options where possible
3. WHEN security tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear remediation steps
4. WHEN improvements are implemented THEN the dashboard SHALL reflect the updated status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want comprehensive security monitoring, so that I can maintain ongoing security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security audits run THEN they SHALL check all OWASP Top 10 2024 categories
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN they SHALL be categorized by severity and impact
3. WHEN security status changes THEN the dashboard SHALL update in real-time
4. WHEN compliance is achieved THEN the system SHALL provide certification-ready reports
